# Feature: README Documentation

## 1. Description

The `README.md` file is the most important piece of documentation for the framework. It will be the first thing that new users see, and it should provide them with all the information they need to get started.

## 2. Intended Functionality

The `README.md` file will be a comprehensive guide to the framework, including:

*   **Introduction:** A brief overview of the project, its goals, and why it's useful.
*   **Features:** A list of the key features of the framework.
*   **Installation:** Clear instructions on how to "install" or download and use the framework scripts.
*   **Getting Started:** A "Hello, World!" style tutorial that walks the user through writing their first test.
*   **API Reference:** A detailed reference for all the available assertion functions, including their syntax and examples.
*   **Advanced Usage:** Information on more advanced features like mocking, configuration, and CI/CD integration.
*   **Contributing:** Guidelines for how other developers can contribute to the project.
*   **License:** The software license for the framework (e.g., MIT).

## 3. Requirements

*   The `README.md` must be well-written, clear, and concise.
*   It must be formatted using Markdown.
*   It should be included in the root of the project repository.

## 4. Dependencies

*   None.

## 5. Limitations

*   The `README.md` is not a substitute for a full documentation website, which could be a future goal. It should focus on being a practical guide for getting started and a quick reference.
